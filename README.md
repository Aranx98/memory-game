Object of the Game

Find the most pairs of matching cards.

Match: A player makes a match if the two cards turned picture-side-up are identical.

When a match is made, the player takes both cards and places them in front of him or her. That player then takes another turn, and continues taking turns until he or she misses.

Miss: A player misses if the two cards turned over are not identical. When a player misses, he or she turns the two cards picture-side-down again, in the same place.

That player's turn ends-and all players try to remember which cards were turned over, for future matches.
